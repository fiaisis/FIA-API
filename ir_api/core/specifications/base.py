Base Specification Module

Defines the abstract base class for creating query specifications.
These specifications are designed to encapsulate the logic for querying the database,
allowing for reusable and composable query objects. This approach aims to separate
the concerns of how objects are retrieved from the database from the rest of the application logic.
