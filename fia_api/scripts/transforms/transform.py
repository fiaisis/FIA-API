"""
This module provides an abstract base class for implementing transformations on a given script. These transformations
apply string manipulations on the script depending on the specific implementation. A custom exception is also defined
for cases where a required transform is missing.

Classes:
Transform (ABC): An abstract base class that defines the interface for applying transformations on a script.
MissingTransformError (Exception): A custom exception for handling cases where a required transform is missing.
